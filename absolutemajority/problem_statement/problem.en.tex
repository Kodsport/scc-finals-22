\problemname{Absolute Majority}
$1 \le N \le 100\,000$ items, each with a secret number $c_i$.
Interactive queries of the form $? a_1 a_2 \dots a_N$: for each query a bitstring $r$ of length $N$ is returned, where $r_i = 1$ if $c_i = c_{a_1}$, else $0$.
Finally a query of the form $! i$ where $i$ should be an index such that strictly more than half of all secret numbers equal $c_i$, or $-1$ indicating there is no majority.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test cases.
If any test case is answered incorrectly, your solution will graded as incorrect.
Otherwise, let $Q$ denote the maximum number of \texttt{?} queries needed for any test case.
Depending on $Q$ your solution will be awarded different number of points.

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $10 < Q \le 30$ your solution will be awarded $10$ points.
  \item If $3 < Q \le 10$ your solution will be awarded $20$ points.
  \item If $Q \le 3$ your solution will be awarded $30$ points.
\end{itemize}
