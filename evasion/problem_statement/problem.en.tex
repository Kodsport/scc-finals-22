\problemname{Evasion}
A monster is loose in a tree with $N$ nodes. The monster starts at node $A$, you start at node $B$. You know which $M$ nodes the monster will walk through thereafter.
You are trying to keep away from the monster, while moving as little as possible. Before the monster makes a move, you may make any number of moves.

What is the minimal number of moves you have to make?

\section*{Input}
The first line contains the integers $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$ ($2 \le N \le 100\,000$, $1 \le M \le 500\,000$, $1 \le A \neq B \le N$). 

The next $N-1$ lines contains the edges of the tree.
Each line consists of two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u \neq v \le N$, the vertices of the edge).

The final line contains $M$ numbers $a_1, \dots, a_M$, the vertices the monster moves through ($1 \le a_i \le N$).
It is guaranteed that $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices of the tree for $1 \le i \le M-1$, and that $A$ and $a_1$ are adjacent.

\section*{Output}
Output a single integer, the minimal number of moves you have to perform to avoid the monster.

If avoiding the monster is impossible, output \texttt{-1}.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
